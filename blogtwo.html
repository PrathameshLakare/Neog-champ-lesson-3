                <p class="grey">When you start a new blog, one of your most important decisions is choosing what blogging software to use. You also need to decide what type of blogger you’ll be. Is there a certain niche that would be a great fit to match your interests and expertise? Whether you’re a new blogger or looking to switch blogging platforms, the range of blogging tools and options you find here can give you a head start on your search for your blogging software and blog niche match </p>

                <h2>Selecting Hosted Blogging Software</h2>
            
                    <p class="grey">When you choose to blog using a hosted blog service, you don’t need to worry about the software technology at all. You can concentrate on the topic for your next blog post, rather than on how to configure a web server. To use hosted blogging software, you log into the editing tool, write a post, click the Publish button, and log out. </p>

                <h2>Being yourself on your blog</h2>

                    <p class="grey">Blogging is quite a personal, conversational medium, and textual blogs have a strong feel of the author and his or her personality. </p>

                    <p class="grey">The first blogs were actually online diaries, and even today, most bloggers choose to use words such as I or my in their blog posts, creating an intimate and open feel — even on corporate blogs. This first-person writing differs dramatically from most corporate communication, which at best refers to the company as our and at worst only refers to the company by its full and official name. </p>
